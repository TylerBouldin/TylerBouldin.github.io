A serve must be completed in an underhand fashion with the paddle below the waist. The ball must travel over the net without hitting the closer side of the court or the kitchen and land in the opponents diagonal court. Both teams must let the ball bounce once on their side before hitting it. After each team has done this (one bounce per side), the ball can be hit either before or after it bounces.",
