        <p>If you are debating on where to go this summer, you should choose a lake! Lakes are a great option if your in need of some relaxation and fun. A lake is a body of water, usually freshwater, that is surrounded by land. Lakes are home to a variety of plants and animals and hopefully you this summer.</p>
